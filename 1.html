  <h2>26.12.20</h2>
i had a lot of fun during christmas,
giving christmas gifts to one another in our room nr.9, eating nice ordered
food from outside.<br> that was the reason i couldnt study for the
civil engineering exam, because i didnt have enough time. <br>plus,
the environment for study here wasnt that good since our base is going
to move to another place. <br>we no more have a library, no more tables for
studying so you have to knee down on a floor and bend your back if you want
to write something. it’s an excuse i know. <br>and i also know that i have not
enough time. <br>maybe i have enough time, that is why i am wasting my time
right now. <br>rong doesnt like to waste time. <br>probably most people dont.<br>
i dont either. <br>perhaps she will stop me watching youtube for wasting time.<br>
thankful to her.<br>
my father wants to have a new phone, but my mom told him not to get a new one,
 for they need a penny to support their kids.<br> i dont like that.<br>
  i will buy him new one next year. <br>only few days are left..</p>
