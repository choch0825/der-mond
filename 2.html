<p><h2>27.12.20</h2>
a trouble in a relationship often comes from self hating.<br>
in my experience, when i do something what i dont like to do
( or show to others) i look around if anyone looks at me.<br>
and i start to think that why others look at me if they really do.<br>
but it is not reality, only made up in my head.<br>
so what is worse is that i do what i dont want to do.<br>
and if this keeps going and going,
i commence to have an inner trouble against others who looked at me in my imagination.<br>
to keep this from the outbursting trouble,
I have to stop hating what I do.<br>
there are two ways of getting rid of the trouble:
the first is to change my mind and the second is to change my behavior (the deed).<br>
it is much harder to change my mind ( thoughts)
than the deed so most people just fix their bad habits instead of having a doubt of the mind that divides what is right and wrong.<br>
if you want to change truely and entirely,
you must change your thoughts. you have to keep asking questions yourself and find a way to build your own answer.<br>
it could lead you to change your behavior in the end, tho it is very different from
just changing your behavior without the process,
because now you understand it with your own heart,
not following what others say or being self-conscious.</p>
