<p><h2>30.12.20</h2>
rong had a little trouble with her mom. <br>
it is not because of an actual trouble between them,
it was just a disharmony of their understanding
 each other. <br>her mom volunteered herself to go to grandma’s house and
 cook for her even she doesnt have to go at all. <br>she, rong’s mom,
 has a great excuse not to go there, tho she wants to go there.<br>
  she sometimes was grumpy about what she’s doing on someone’s birthday,
  cooking, but she enjoys it a lot too. <br>
  or as she herself told her daughter, rong,
  that it became a habit with a lot of time spent with it. <br>
  rong doesnt understand and becomes mad. <br>
  and grumbles about the fact that her mom has to
  take this hard work job for the grandma. <br>
  rong loves her mom very much. <br>at the same time she became even
   more mad for her dad takes it for granted.<br>
    her dad is a typical korean man, who does “outside job” and
     takes for granted as his wife taking care of inside
     one including his parents’ birthday and anniversary. <br>
     rong even doesnt understand more that her father never
     says thank you to her mom depite of the fact
     that her mom does hard work.<br>
this is a problem of an understanding.<br>
in my opinion, we are living in relationships and
the relationships we have are different from what others have,
even they look very similar, and we think, sometimes,
 we could think they are pretty the same when they go
 together with whom we are close to. <br>i mean if i have a
 relationship with mom and dad each, it doesnt mean that
 i could be involved in their own relationship.<br>
there are my brothers young and mun. <br>
i am good with both of them. <br>young is my twin brother,
 and mun is my older brother who i follow with respect.<br>
  and they are good to each other as well. <br>but in my aspect,
   there are three relationships.: <br>
   1. young and i. <br>
   2. mun and i. <br>
   3. young, mun and i. <br>
   we all are different bodies therefore different
   minds and understanding skills.<br>
a person who thinks he is the only one like
a main character in movies probably finds that
he is in the middle of everything, especially when he
is with comfortable ones.<br>
back to the rong’s story, her parents might have
understood each other without saying it.<br> or she is now
 used to do such things for real. <br>then could we correct
 it to a right way even tho she is okay with it? isnt it too
  much force taking free away from her? <br>or she will be fine
   later when she would be adjusted what’s changed.<br>
we never know and there’s no answer. <br>it depends on ideas
 how we try to think. <br>focusing on a certain idea swallows
 our mind and we easily fall into a conclusion.</p>
